## For those who are interested in processors

There's a game on Steam called [Turing Complete](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/) that allows you to build a processor from scratch. Even though I didn't buy it because I missed the discount, it seems to be a lot of fun.

## For those who are boring now

Here are some fun things:

1. Even though this is a web app, I still packaged a desktop version using Tauri to make it look **professional**.
2. If you want to use `react-mosaic`, be prepared to face the question: "How do I get the window size?"
3. I eventually turned `typescript` into `anyscript`.
4. Can you believe that nobody has ever written an open-source hex editor in React?
5. The icon of this app is simply the Beta Processor's icon, split diagonally in half.
